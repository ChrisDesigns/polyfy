# Polyfy

### Inspiration
Math has a long history of appearing in nature and art. This is an example of us trying to recreate how art can be created mathematically.

### What it does
Creates Low Poly art from images and in real-time by video. Using[ Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation " Delaunay triangulation") and [features from accelerated segment test (FAST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_from_accelerated_segment_test "features from accelerated segment test (FAST)"), we're able to put object points as triangles as a filter over a video feed.
